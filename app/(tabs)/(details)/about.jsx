        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          EnviroWatch is a dynamic app designed to bridge the gap between communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government agencies. Our platform allows users to post issues related to their specific region, whether it’s environmental concerns, infrastructure problems, social welfare needs, or any other local challenges. These issues are then visible to relevant NGOs and government bodies, enabling them to take timely and appropriate action.
